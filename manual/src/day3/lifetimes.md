# Lifetimes

We're looking at lifetimes and the borrow checker together, because they are inextricably linked. The borrow checker prevents use-after-move, enforces ownership, and ensures that you don't have even the faintest possibility of changing the same piece of data from two places at a time.

Lifetimes attack another very common bug: using a pointer after the item being pointed to is no longer available (it moved, was freed, etc.).

If you're coming from C or C++, lifetimes can be very annoying---but you've probably run into cases where you kept a reference to something and it ceased to exist.

If you're coming from a garbage collected language (like Go, Java, etc.)---or use `shared_ptr` everywhere in C++---you're probably wondering what the big deal is.

Rust is a low-level, systems language without a garbage collector. In order to guaranty that you aren't running into a lifetime issue, Rust imposes some rules---and those rules can take a bit of getting used to.

## Lifetimes with Functions

Take the following useless function:

```rust
fn do_something(x: &i32) {
    println!("{x}"); 
}

fn main() {
    let x = 12;
    do_something(&x);
}
```

You are passing in a *borrowed reference* to an `i32`---meaning that `main` is borrowing `x`. When Rust was first conceived, you'd have had to write:

```rust
fn do_something<'a>(x: &'a i32) {
    println!("{x}"); 
}
```

You're declaring that `do_something` is connected to a *lifetime* (denoted by `'`) named `a`. The *borrow* is annotated (as `&'a`) to indicate that it uses the lifetime for that particular borrow. With that knowledge, Rust can be *certain* that whatever was passed in will *live long enough* for `do_something` to run.

The funny thing is, the first version is translated by Rust to include a lifetime (an anonymous lifetime)---but because it's an easily resolved case, the compiler can do it for you.

> Don't complicate your code with lifetimes when you don't need them!

### Functions that return a reference - and take more than one reference

Where you can't avoid lifetime annotations is any function that returns a reference, and *receives* more than one reference. For example:

```rust
fn get_x(x: &i32, _y: &i32) -> &i32 {
    x
}

fn main() {
    let a = 1;
    let b = 2;
    let _ = get_x(&a, &b);
}
```

This will fail to compile with:
```
error[E0106]: missing lifetime specifier
 --> src/main.rs:1:32
  |
1 | fn get_x(x: &i32, _y: &i32) -> &i32 {
  |             ----      ----     ^ expected named lifetime parameter
  |

  |         ++++     ++           ++          ++

```

Rust can't determine *which* reference lifetime it needs to worry about. In such a simple case, it's obvious---but not to the compiler. You can correct it by annotating lifetimes:

```rust
fn get_x<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32, _y: &'b i32) -> &'a i32 {
    x
}

fn main() {
    let a = 1;
    let b = 2;
    let _ = get_x(&a, &b);
}
```

That's ugly---but it gets the job done.

## Lifetimes for Structures

It's very common to keep a reference around for use later. Rust has no problems with letting you store a reference in a structure, so long as you provide a lifetime annotation:

```rust
struct Cat(String);

struct CatFeeder<'a> {
    cat: &'a Cat
}

fn main() {
    let cats = vec![
        Cat("Frodo".to_string()),
        Cat("Bilbo".to_string()),
        Cat("Pippin".to_string()),
    ];
    
    let mut feeders = Vec::new();
    for cat in cats.iter() {
        feeders.push(CatFeeder{ cat })
    }
}
```

Now let's try and be a bit object-oriented. The syntax starts to get a bit messy, but the latest edition of Rust allows the borrow-checker and lifetime checker to handle in-vector mutable borrowing and keep a mutable reference around:

```rust
struct Cat(String);

struct CatFeeder<'a> {
    cat: &'a mut Cat
}

impl Cat {
    fn feed(&mut self) {
        self.0 = format!("{} (purring)", self.0);
    }
}

impl<'a> CatFeeder<'a> {
    fn feed(&mut self) {
        self.cat.feed();
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut cats = vec![
        Cat("Frodo".to_string()),
        Cat("Bilbo".to_string()),
        Cat("Pippin".to_string()),
    ];
    
    let mut feeders = Vec::new();
    for cat in cats.iter_mut() {
        feeders.push(CatFeeder{ cat })
    }
    
    feeders.iter_mut().for_each(|f| f.feed());
}
```

So far, so good. You had to ugly up `impl<'a> CatFeeder<'a>` to tell it to *implement for lifetime 'a, CatFeeder that requires lifetime 'a*. Verbose, but functional.

Now let's see what the lifetime protection---which sounds like insurance---is doing. We'll take `cats` out of scope before we feed them:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut feeders = Vec::new();
    {
        let mut cats = vec![
            Cat("Frodo".to_string()),
            Cat("Bilbo".to_string()),
            Cat("Pippin".to_string()),
        ];
        
        for cat in cats.iter_mut() {
            feeders.push(CatFeeder{ cat })
        }
    }
    
    feeders.iter_mut().for_each(|f| f.feed());
}
```

When the scope containing `cats` ends, the `cats` list ceases to exist. In C++, you'll probably get a warning from modern compilers---but the code is valid. It's undefined behavior what will happen when you feed the cats---their pointers are no longer valid. When you compile it in Rust, it shows you exactly what's wrong:

```
error[E0597]: `cats` does not live long enough
  --> src/main.rs:28:20
   |
28 |         for cat in cats.iter_mut() {
   |                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ borrowed value does not live long enough
...
31 |     }
   |     - `cats` dropped here while still borrowed
32 |     
33 |     feeders.iter_mut().for_each(|f| f.feed());
   |     ------------------ borrow later used here

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0597`.
```

The lifetime checker just saved you from a bug. It's obvious in this context, now imagine that you have a large programming passing and storing pointers all over. Rust may have just saved you from another CVE report.

The real lesson is: keep pointers for *exactly* as long as you need them, and no longer. It's far better to maintain a unique ID for each animal, a central animal collection, and have feeders refer to the ID. That way, you can check that the cat still exists---and if Schr√∂dinger's cat has ceased to exist, you don't try to feed it. 

## Combine with Rc

You can use `Rc` and `Arc` to avoid most of these problems. The overhead is minimal---and you retain safety. You can count on the reference counter to keep your data alive while it's being referenced.
